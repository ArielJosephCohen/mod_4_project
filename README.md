# Goals

Accurately develop a model to determine the importance of the NFL draft combine in terms of its effects on draft selection. In other words, if a player with no history of success performs well at the combine, I want to see if that player will rise in the draft or not.

# Business Application

This project is a bit more subjective in terms of its use in the real world. It was more of a personal inquiry as to whether the draft combine matters or not.

# Statistical Methods Leveraged
